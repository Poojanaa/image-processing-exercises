**Image Processing Python Libraries**<br>
Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers and systems to extract useful information from digital photos, videos, and other visual inputs and initiate actions or make recommendations based on that data. Image processing, which is the phenomenon of manipulating or editing, or performing some operations on an image to extract features from it, is required to extract this information.<br>
1. OpenCV<br>
OpenCV is one of the most famous and widely used open-source libraries for computer vision tasks such as image processing, object detection, face detection, image segmentation, face recognition, and many more. Other than this, it can also be used for machine learning tasks.<br>
Gray Scaling
Gray-scaling is a method of converting a 3 channel image eg, RGB, HSV, etc into a single channel image i.e to shades of grey. The final image varies between complete white and black. The importance of Gray-Scaling includes Dimension reduction (converting 3 channels to a single-channel image), Reduce model complexity, etc.<br>
Rotate Image
OpenCV helps use to rotate the image by any degree ranges from 0 to 360 degrees.<br>
OpenCV provides other functionalities as well other than what we have discussed so far. Apart from this, it also helps in Face Detection, Image Segmentation, Feature Extraction, Object Detection, 3-D Reconstruction, and many more.<br>
